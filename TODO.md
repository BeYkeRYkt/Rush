Following things needs to be done or are planned to be coded. 
Feel free to post a pull request if you get following things working:

* [FIXED]Multiplayer support. Since MC 1.3.2, when second player joins something gets screwed up
  and both players "lost connection". Best explanation is to try it. Before (MC 1.2.5 and older) 
  it was working absolutely fine.[/FIXED]
* Proper world save. Since updating to MC 1.2.5, the world save is broken due to the new Anvil format.
* Configuration.
* Entities - spawning is done (/spawn), metadata partially (/meta). I plan make killing entities possible
  and also some simple AI.
* Server side inventory.
* Make it compatible with both Minecraft 1.2.5 and 1.6.4. (Possible, but needs additional work)
* Fix placing bug: Placing a block added in MC 1.3.2 and later causes client to crash.
