Todo
==========

Following things needs to be done or are planned to be coded. 
Feel free to post a pull request if you get following things working:

* Proper world save. Since updating to MC 1.2.5, the world save is broken due to the new Anvil format.
* Configuration.
* Entities - spawning is done (/spawn), metadata partially (/meta). I plan make killing entities possible
  and also some simple AI.
* Server side inventory.
* Make it compatible with both Minecraft 1.6.4 and 1.7.9. (Possible, but need additional work).
* Fix placing bug: Placing a block added in MC 1.3.2 and later causes client to crash.
